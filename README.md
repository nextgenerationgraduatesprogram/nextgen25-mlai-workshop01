<h1>CSIRO NextGen25 Machine Learning Workshop #1</h1>

This workshop is designed to give participants a **foundational, conceptual understanding** of machine learning by focusing on the fundamental idea: machine learning is the process of **learning functions from data**. Rather than centering on specific architectures or black-box model usage, this workshop takes a bottom-up approach — exploring what it means to define, approximate, and optimize functions based on noisy observations.
